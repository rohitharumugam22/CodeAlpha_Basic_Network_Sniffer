# CodeAlpha_Basic_Network_Sniffer
 # Overview
  This project is a network sniffer tool implemented in Python. It captures and analyzes network traffic, providing detailed information about each packet. The tool utilizes the Npcap library for packet capture on Windows systems.

 # Features
  * Captures network packets in real-time.
  * Provides detailed information about each packet, including source and destination IP addresses, protocol, packet length, time of capture, TTL, flags, and more.
  * Supports analysis of various protocols such as TCP, UDP, and ICMP.
  * Displays source and destination MAC addresses for Ethernet packets.
  * Supports capturing and analyzing fragmented IP packets.
  * Provides TCP-specific information such as sequence numbers, acknowledgment numbers, and TCP flags.
    
 # Installation
  * Install the required dependencies:
    
         pip install scapy

  * Install Npcap:
   * Visit the Npcap website and download the appropriate installer for your system.
   * Run the installer and follow the installation instructions.
     
 # Usage
  * Navigate to the project directory:
    
        cd network-sniffer
    
  * Run the network sniffer script:

        python sniffer.py
    
The script will start capturing network packets and display detailed information about each packet in real-time.
